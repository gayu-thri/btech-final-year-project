#### A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO CONTROL A GAME BASED ON HAND GESTURES USING A LOW-RESOLUTION CAMERA

Though Deep learning and Neural Network is used as a potential tool to comprehend a considerable lot of this present reality learning and trans-formation issues, the research projects revealing the simple facts of how to simulate a game application using human gestures with reduced latency and low-resolution camera are very scarce. 

This project has in its objective to present the details of design and implementation of gesture-controlled game application using deep learning and neural network. A simple third-party game application is taken into consideration and the keyboard inputs used to control the game are controlled through hand gestures with a low-resolution camera with reduced latency.

This project initially unfolds with much focus on building an efficient deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow that could recognize and validate the hand gestures which are fed as inputs through a low-resolution camera. Next, the corresponding keyboard key is predicted for the corresponding input and the keyboard is simulated in real time when the game application is run. 

Keywords â€“ _Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Gesture control, Tensor-Flow, Keras._
